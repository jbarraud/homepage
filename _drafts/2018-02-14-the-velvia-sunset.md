Taking photos on my commute has become a thing over the years. I like photography, commute four hours a day, and occasionally see some interesting things out the windows. Typically I take these photos with my phone, but lately I've been making it a habit of caring my [Fujifilm X100F](https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-X100F-APS-C-Digital-Camera/dp/B01N33CT3Z/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1518646155&sr=8-3&keywords=x100f) with me as often as I remember. I love the camera and the photos it produces, particularly the film emulations.

I shoot JPG 99% of the time because they look great and don't have the time for processing RAW photos. The film simulations in the X-Series cameras are excellent. The camera does some kind of magic with it's processing that it's very hard to recreate the exact look of the simulations in post with a RAW file. Yes, there are Ligthroom profiles, but they still don't match what you get in-camera.

On the way home last night there was a blazing orange sunset. I tried to capture it with my camera and noticed the images weren't representative of what I was seeing. Due to the film simulation being set to Classic Chrome, which is typical for me. Switched it to Velvia and the tones of the images appeared closer to the sunset I was trying to capture.

I've never been a big fan of Velvia, but it's probably because I've never used it in conditions it's meant for, highly saturated scenes. The look of the Classic Chrome images I captured are great. But they didn't contain tones I wanted to capture, the blazing orange glow of the sunset.

The images in this post are straight out of the camera aside from cropping and straightening. The only other factor to the colors are the tinted bus windows.

Thanks to this little bus experiment I'll be looking for opportunities to use Velvia more. Not only that, I'll be looking to try different film simulations on scenes they're not exactly suited for.
